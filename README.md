# refactor-horiseon# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description


- My goal with this project is to convert the html file non-semantic into semantic. This will allow search engines to better understand the context and structure of the webpage. As well as improved search ranking. Furthermore, include all kind of users and render a greater user experience.
- Building this project allowed me to improve my knowledge semantic knowledge and skills.
- These changes have two major solutions. By converting the structure to semantic the website will have a high search ranking. This will benefit Horiseon greatly. The second solution is by changing the HTML structure to semantic every user will be able to better navigate through the website.
- I learned how to structure html semantic files. I learned the different functions of html semantic elements.
